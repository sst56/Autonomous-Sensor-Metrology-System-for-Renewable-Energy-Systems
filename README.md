# Autonomous-Sensor-Metrology


The Metrology system has a purpose of monitoring an autonomous renewable energy generation facility. This facility produces electrical energy from two solar panels and two sea wave generators. This energy is then stored in two banks of 4 LiFePO4 batteries connected in series for a power bus voltage of 12.8V. This energy is then used to power a variety of environmental sensors and the monitoring systems necessary. In the end the data are transmitted through a LoRa wireless interface to a wifi gateway which connects the system to an online server. The data and control of the system can be accessed through a mobile application.

The system consists of three arduino boards and the esp32 gateway. The first arduino board is responsible for accepting and decoding the NMEA messages from the GPS board. Then it stores the data, and when needed sends the data to the main arduino board through the I2C bus. The second board is responsible for constrolling the buck converter for achieving MPPT tracking and the state of charge of the batteries. THe data are sent to the main board through a Serial port. The main board receives and packages all the data in order to send them to the wifi gateway through the LoRa wireless module. Finally, the wifi gateway is responsible for sending the data to a server. From there, the data can be acessed with a smartphone app.
